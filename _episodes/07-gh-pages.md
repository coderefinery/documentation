## Create an example project website and host it on GitHub Pages

In this demo we will create a very simple project website and host it on [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/). [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/) and [Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/publishing-a-website-on-bitbucket-cloud-221449776.html) also offer a
very similar solution. The key is that you can give the hosting to
professionals so that you can focus on your project.

Every project `<projectname>` on GitHub under the user/namespace `<user>` which
contains a branch `gh-pages` is served on
`https://<user>.github.io/<projectname>/`.

This is how all https://coderefinery.org material is hosted.

---

### Context

- We will use a particular framework: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) which generates HTML from Markdown.
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is one out of many possible tools (static site generators, more on this later).
- The point of this exercise is not to focus on Jekyll or Markdown but to demonstrate that
  **you can serve webpages via GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket pages**.
- If we wanted we could serve HTML generated by Sphinx from previous exercise via GitHub pages instead
  of Read the Docs.

---

### Example

Let us try it out!

- First fork and clone the [example repository](https://github.com/coderefinery/gh-pages-example).
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/user/gh-pages-example.git  # adapt user
$ cd gh-pages-example
```
- Check that you are indeed on the `gh-pages` branch.
- Make some changes to `index.md` or `about.md`or `team.md`, commit and push.
```shell
$ git add index.md team.md  # add changes to commit
$ git commit -m "modified website contents"
$ git push origin gh-pages
```
- Verify that your changes land on `https://<user>.github.io/gh-pages-example/` (it may take a couple of seconds).

Yay! Now you have successfully deployed a website!

### Discussion

What just happened?
- the example uses [GitHub Pages supported themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/).
- we define the theme we want to use in `_config.yml`
- add the page layout that we want to use in the beginning of the Markdown files. This is called [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

Thats it! Github takes care of rendering the pages - see the
[documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-jekyll-theme-to-your-github-pages-site/).

It is a good idea to keep source code, web sources, and possibly also Sphinx
source all in the same repository, tracking a common history.

GitHub pages can be configured to also serve directly from the master branch
under `docs/` - see the [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/).

Many people put their personal home page on repository `<user>.github.io`, which is served
on `https://<user>.github.io`.

It is no problem to use a custom domain instead of `*.github.io`.

### Where you might want to go from here

- There are many web frameworks available.
- **Static site generators** allow modular websites and play well with GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket Pages which serve static sites:
  - [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
  - [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
  - [Hexo](https://hexo.io)
  - Many others
- See the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://pages.github.com) for step-by-step guides.
- It is no problem to serve GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket Pages using your **own domain name**.
- Do not reinvent the wheel - **use CSS frameworks**:
    - [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
    - [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com)
