# Motivation and wishlist

```{questions}
- Why documenting code?
- What is our wishlist on a suitably good documentation?
```

```{objectives}
- Arrive at a checklist for designing and deploying code documentation.
```

## Why documenting code?

> ## Exercise in the main room
>
> - **Use the collaborative document**.
> - Is project documentation important? Why?
> - How would you describe a useful documentation?
> - How can you motivate your colleagues to contribute to the documentation?
{: .challenge}

> ## Our motivation (but let us brainstorm first)
>
> - You will probably use your code in the future and may forget details.
> - You may want others to use your code (almost impossible without documentation).
> - You may want others to contribute to the code.
> - Shield your limited time and let the documentation answer FAQs.

### Own examples

We would like to show you some examples which are not ideal but we do not want
to point at others.

Instead we list some of the projects we have contributed to (possibly long time
ago), with varying quality of documentation:

- [Dalton](https://daltonprogram.org/documentation/) (check the PDF
  manuals, e.g. [Dalton 2018](https://daltonprogram.org/manuals/dalton2018manual.pdf))
- [Cubicle](https://github.com/bast/cubicle)
- [Numgrid](https://github.com/dftlibs/numgrid)
- [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools)

Discuss in groups what you like / or don't like about each before discussing it
as a class.

If you have examples of your own which you would like to share (on this website
or verbally), please do!

## What do we expect from a suitably good documentation?

> ## Documentation comes in different forms - what *is* documentation?
>
> (This is adapted from: [What nobody tells you about documentation](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/))
>
> - **Tutorials**: learning-oriented, allows the newcomer to get started
> - **How-to guides**: goal-oriented, shows how to solve a specific problem
> - **Explanation**: understanding-oriented, explains a concept
> - **Reference**: information-oriented, describes the machinery
>
> These are distinct. For an excellent discussion,
> please see [What nobody tells you about documentation](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/).

**There is no one size fits all**: often for small projects a `README.md` or
`README.rst` can be enough (more about these formats later).

> ## Exercise in the main room: Create a wishlist
>
> - **Use the collaborative document**.
> - Let us create a wishlist for how we would like documentation to be.
> - Below are some of our ideas but please do not look at them yet.
> - We are sure you will come up with ideas we did not think about.
{: .challenge}

> ## Our wishlist (but let us brainstorm first)
>
> ### Versions
>
> - Your code project should be versioned (version control).
> - Enable reproducibility and avoid confusion: **documentation should be versioned** as well.
> - Have you ever seen: *"We will soon release a new version and are updating the documentation.
>   Some features may not be available in the version you have downloaded."*?
>
>
> ### Documentation should be placed and tracked close to the source code
>
> - Documenting **close to the source code** (e.g. subdirectory ``doc/``) minimizes barrier to contribute.
> - I should not need to log in to another machine or service and jump through hoops to contribute.
> - It is often good enough to have a `README.md` or `README.rst` along with your code/script.
>
>
> ### Use a standard markup language
>
> - Use either
>   [reStructuredText (RST)](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) or
>   [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) markup.
> - GitHub and GitLab automatically render `README.md` or `README.rst` files.
>
>
> ### Copy-paste-able
>
> - PDF alone is not enough since **copy-pasting out of a PDF document can be difficult**.
> - It is OK to provide a generated PDF in addition to a copy-paste-able format.
>
>
> ### Written by humans
>
> - Automatically generated documentation (e.g. API documentation) is useful as
>   complementary documentation but it does not replace tutorials written by
>   humans.
>
>
> ### Installation instructions
>
> - Give **step by step instructions for the basic case**.
>   Additional information and caveats can be linked from there.
> - List requirements and dependencies (libraries, compilers, environment).
> - Include instructions for how to test for correctness after installation.
>
>
> ### Make the license explicit
>
> - **Include a LICENSE file** with your source code.
> - Without a license, your work is under exclusive copyright by default:
>   others are not allowed to re-use or modify anything.
> - GitHub and GitLab allows to choose a license from common license templates.
>
>
> ### Information for contributors
>
> - Make it easy for others to contribute: **document how you prefer others to contribute**.
> - Users of your code may be shy to contribute code.
>   Your **documentation provides a platform for your first contributions**.

> ## Documentation checklist
>
> Which items to include depends on the number of users apart from yourself.
>
> - Purpose
> - Authors
> - License
> - Recommended citation
> - Copy-paste-able example to get started
> - Dependencies and their versions or version ranges
> - Installation instructions
> - Tutorials covering key functionality
> - Reference documentation (e.g. API) covering all functionality
> - How do you want to be asked questions (mailing list or forum or chat or issue tracker)
> - Possibly a FAQ section
> - Contribution guide

### Good resources

- [A beginnerâ€™s guide to writing documentation](http://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/)
- [What nobody tells you about documentation](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/)

```{keypoints}
- Documentation is part of the code and should be versionable.
- Documentation (sources) should be tracked with the corresponding code in the same repository.
- Use lightweight and standard markup languages such as reStructuredText or Markdown.
```
