# Deploying Sphinx documentation to GitHub Pages

```{objectives}
- Create a basic workflow which you can take home and adapt for your project.
```

## [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

- Serve websites from a GitHub repository
- It is no problem to serve using your own URL `http://myproject.org` instead of `http://myuser.github.io/myproject`


## [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions/)

- Automatically runs code when your repository changes
- We will run Sphinx build and make the result available to GitHub Pages
- Equations and images no problem
- Can use Sphinx styles

## Typical workflow

- Host source code with documentation sources on a public Git repository.
- Each time you `git push` to the repository, a GitHub action triggers to
  rebuild the documentation.
- The documentation is pushed to a separate branch called 'gh-pages'.

## Exercise

``````{challenge} Exercise: Deploy Sphinx documentation to GitHub Pages.
In this exercise we will fork an example repository on GitHub and
deploy it to GitHub Pages. The example project contains a script for
counting the frequency distribution of words in a given file and some
documentation generated using Sphinx. For bigger projects, we can have
more source files.

**Step 1:** Go to the [word-count project template](https://github.com/coderefinery/word-count/generate)
on GitHub and fork it to your namespace.

**Clone the repository**

The repository contains following two folders, among few other files and folders:
- **source** folder contains the source code
- **doc** folder contains the Sphinx documentation

The doc folder contains the Sphinx configuration file (`conf.py`) and the index file (`index.rst`) and some contents (other RST files).
The `conf.py` file has been adjusted to be able to autogenerate documentation from sources.


**Build HTML pages locally**

Inside the cloned repository, build the documentation and verify the result in your browser:

```console
$ sphinx-build doc _build
```

**Test HTML pages links**

Inside the cloned repository, check the integrity of all internal and external links:

```console
$ sphinx-build doc -W -b linkcheck -d _build/doctrees _build/html
```

**Step 2:** Add the GitHub Action

- Create a new file at `.github/workflows/documentation.yaml` with the contents

```
name: Docs
on: [push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch]
jobs:
  docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme
      - name: Sphinx build
        run: |
          sphinx-build doc _build
      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/master' }}
        with:
          publish_branch: gh-pages
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: _build/
          force_orphan: true
```

You don't need to understand all of the above, but you
might spot familiar commands in the `run:` sections.

- Add, commit and push to GitHub
- Check the action at https://github.com/myuser/word-count/actions

**Step 2:** Enable GitHub Pages

- Go to https://github.com/myuser/word-count/settings/pages
- In the "Source" section, choose "gh-pages" in the dropdown menu and click
  save
- Your documentation will appear at
  https://github.com/myuser/word-count/settings/pages


**Verify the result**

That's it! Your site should now be live on
https://github.com/myuser/word-count/settings/pages (replace username and
project name).

**Verify refreshing the documentation**

Finally, make some changes to your documentation
- Add documentation related to other functions
- Prerequisites and how to use the program
- Rules for contribution
- Some example results (figures, tables, ...)
- Commit and push them, and verify that the documentation website refreshes after your changes (can take few seconds or a minute)
``````

```{callout} Do not add the generated build directory to your repository
The `_build` directory is generated locally with the command `sphinx-build
doc _build` and allows you to check the content locally but it should not be
part of the Git repository.  We recommend to add `_build` to `.gitignore` to
prevent you from accidentally adding files below `_build` to the Git
repository.
```


## Alternatives to Read the Docs

[GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/) and [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) can create a very similar workflow.

[Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org) is the most common alternative to
hosting in GitHub Pages.

You can host your own Sphinx server. If you want to know more about it, look at:
- [https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
- [https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autobuild/](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autobuild/)
- [https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-server/](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-server/)

You can also build Sphinx using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
([example workflow for building this lesson](https://github.com/coderefinery/documentation/blob/main/.github/workflows/sphinx.yml)).


## Migrating your own documentation to Sphinx

- First convert your documentation to RST using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)
- Create a file `index.rst` which lists all other RST files and provides the
  table of contents.
- Add a `conf.py` file. You can generate a starting point for `conf.py` and
  `index.rst` with `sphinx-quickstart`, or you can take the examples in this
  lesson as inspiration.
- Test building the documentation locally with `sphinx-build`.
- Once this works, follow the above steps to build and deploy to GitHub Pages.
