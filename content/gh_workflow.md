# Deploying Sphinx documentation to GitHub Pages

```{objectives}
- Create a basic workflow which you can take home and adapt for your project.
```

## [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

- Serve websites from a GitHub repository.
- It is no problem to serve using your own URL `https://myproject.org` instead of `https://myuser.github.io/myproject`.


## [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions/)

- Automatically runs code when your repository changes.
- We will let it run `sphinx-build` and make the result available to GitHub Pages.


## Our goal: putting it all together

- Host source code with documentation sources on a public Git repository.
- Each time we `git push` to the repository, a GitHub action triggers to
  rebuild the documentation.
- The documentation is pushed to a separate branch called 'gh-pages'.

## Exercise - Deploy Sphinx documentation to GitHub Pages

````{exercise} GH-Pages-1: Deploy Sphinx documentation to GitHub Pages
In this exercise we will create an example repository on GitHub and
deploy it to GitHub Pages.

**Step 1**: Go to the [documentation-example](https://github.com/coderefinery/documentation-example/generate) project template
on GitHub and create a copy to your namespace.
- Give it a name, for instance "documentation-example".
- You don't need to "Include all branches"
- Click on "Create a repository".

**Step 2**: Browse the new repository.
- It will look very familar to the previous episode.
- However, we have moved the documentation part under `doc/` (many projects do it this
  way). But it is still a Sphinx documentation project.
- The source code for your project could then go under `src/`.


**Step 3**: Add the GitHub Action to your new Git repository.
- Add a new file at `.github/workflows/documentation.yml` (either through terminal or web interface), containing:
```yaml
name: documentation

on: [push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch]

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme myst_parser
      - name: Sphinx build
        run: |
          sphinx-build doc _build
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}
        with:
          publish_branch: gh-pages
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: _build/
          force_orphan: true
```
- You don't need to understand all of the above, but you
  might spot familiar commands in the `run:` sections.
- After the file has been committed (and pushed),
  check the action at `https://github.com/USER/documentation-example/actions`
  (replace `USER` with your GitHub username).

**Step 4**: Enable GitHub Pages
- On GitHub go to "Settings" -> "Pages".
- In the "Source" section, choose "Deploy form a branch" in the dropdown menu.
- In the "Branch" section choose "gh-pages" and "/root" in the dropdown menus and click
  save.
- You should now be able to verify the pages deployment in the Actions list).

**Step 5**: Verify the result
- Your site should now be live on `https://USER.github.io/documentation-example/` (replace USER).

**Step 6**: Verify refreshing the documentation
- Commit some changes to your documentation
- Verify that the documentation website refreshes after your changes (can take few seconds or a minute)

## Alternatives to GitHub Pages

- [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/)
  and [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) can create a very similar workflow.

- [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org) is the most common alternative to
  hosting in GitHub Pages.

- Sphinx builds HTML files (this is what static site generators do), and you
  can host them anywhere, for example your university's web space or own web server.


## Migrating your own documentation to Sphinx

- First convert your documentation to Markdown using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org).
- Create a file `index.rst` which lists all other Markdown files and provides the
  table of contents.
- Add a `conf.py` file. You can generate a starting point for `conf.py` and
  `index.rst` with `sphinx-quickstart`, or you can take the examples in this
  lesson as inspiration.
- Test building the documentation locally with `sphinx-build`.
- Once this works, follow the above steps to build and deploy to GitHub Pages or some other web space.

```{keypoints}
- Sphinx makes simple HTML (and more) files, so it is easy to find a place to host them.
- Github Pages + Github Actions provides a convenient way to make
  sites and host them on the web.
