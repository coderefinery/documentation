# Deploying Sphinx documentation to Read the Docs

```{questions}
- How do Python projects deploy their documentation?
- Can we use their solutions for projects which do not use Python?
```

```{objectives}
- Create a basic workflow which you can take home and adapt for your project.
```

## [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org)

- Runs Sphinx and converts RST or Markdown to HTML and PDF and hosts them for you
- Equations and images no problem
- Layout can be styled
- Many projects use [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org) as their main site
- It is no problem to serve using your own URL `http://myproject.org` instead of `http://myproject.readthedocs.io`

### Typical Read the Docs workflow

- Host source code with documentation sources on a public Git repository.
- Each time you `git push` to the repository, a `post-receive` hook triggers
  Read the Docs to rebuild the documentation.
- Read the Docs then clones the repository, runs Sphinx,
  and rebuilds HTML and PDF.
- No problem to build several branches (versions) of your documentation.

> ## Exercise: Deploy Sphinx documentation to Read the Docs
>
> In this exercise we will make a copy of an [example repository](https://github.com/coderefinery/word-count/) on GitHub and
> deploy it to Read the Docs. The example project contains a script for
> counting the frequency distribution of words in a given file and some
> documentation generated using Sphinx. For bigger projects, we will have much
> more source files.
>
> We will use GitHub for this exercise but it will also work with any Git
> repository with public read access.
>
> 1. In the first step, we will make a copy of the example repository and then
>    clone the newly created repository to our laptop.
> 2. In the second step, we will enable the project on Read the Docs, then
>    commit and push some changes and check that the documentation is
>    automatically rebuilt.
>
> ### Step 1: Go to the [word-count project template](https://github.com/coderefinery/word-count/generate) and copy it to your namespace
>
> **Clone the repository**
>
> The repository contains following two folders, among few other files and folders:
> - **source** folder contains the source code
> - **doc** folder contains the Sphinx documentation
>
> The doc folder contains the Sphinx configuration file (`conf.py`) and the
> index file (`index.rst`) and some contents (other RST files).
> The `conf.py` file has been adjusted to be able to autogenerate documentation from sources.
>
>
> **Build HTML pages locally**
>
> Inside the cloned repository, build the documentation and verify the result in your browser:
>```shell
>$ sphinx-build doc _build
>```
>
>
> **Test HTML pages links**
>
> Inside the cloned repository, check the integrity of all external links:
>```
>$ sphinx-build doc -W -b linkcheck -d _build/doctrees _build/html
>```
>
> ### Step 2: Enable the project on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org)
>
> **Import a project to Read the Docs by connecting to GitHub**
>
> - Log into [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org) and visit your [dashboard](https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/)
> - Click "Import a Project"
> - Select "Connect to GitHub", and choose the word-count repository
> - Rename the project to user-word-count (replacing "user" with your GitHub username: we need a unique project name)
> - Click "Next"
>
> **Verify the result**
>
> That's it! Your site should now be live on
> http://user-word-count.readthedocs.io (replace project name).
>
> **Verify refreshing the documentation**
>
> Finally, make some changes to your documentation
>   - Add documentation related to other functions
>   - Prerequisites and how to use the program
>   - Rules for contribution
>   - Some example results (figures, tables, ...)
>   - Commit and push them, and verify that the documentation website refreshes after your changes
>     (can take few seconds or a minute)

> ## Do not add the generated build directory to your repository
>
> The `_build` directory is generated locally with the command `sphinx-build doc _build`
> and allows you to check the content locally but it should not be part of the Git repository.
> We recommend to add `_build` to `.gitignore` to prevent you from accidentally
> adding files below `_build` to the Git repository.

> ## Running your own sphinx server
>
> We recommend to use Read the Docs to host your documentation but if you
> prefer, you can host your own Sphinx server.
> If you want to know more about it, look at:
> - [https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
> - [https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autobuild/](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autobuild/)
> - [https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-server/](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-server/)

> ## Migrating your own documentation to Sphinx/ Read the Docs
>
> - First convert your documentation to RST using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)
> - Create a file `index.rst` which lists all other RST files and provides the
>   table of contents.
> - Add a `conf.py` file. You can generate a starting point for `conf.py` and
>   `index.rst` with `sphinx-quickstart`, or you can take the examples in this
>   lesson as inspiration.
> - Test building the documentation locally with `sphinx-build`.
> - Once this works, enable the project on Read the Docs and try to push a
>   change to your documentation.
