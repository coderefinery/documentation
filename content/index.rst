Code documentation lesson
=========================

In this lesson we will discuss different solutions for implementing and
deploying code documentation.

We will learn how to build documentation with the
**documentation generator** `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`__ (and compare it
with others) and how to
deploy it to `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org>`__, a service which hosts
open documentation for free.

This demonstration will be **independent of programming languages** and relevant
also for your Fortran, C, C++, R, or Matlab projects.

We will also learn how
to deploy a **project website or personal homepage** to `GitHub Pages <https://pages.github.com>`__.
The approach that we will learn will be transferable to
`GitLab Pages <https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/>`__ and
`Bitbucket Pages <https://pages.bitbucket.io>`__.


.. prereq::

   1. Basic understanding of Git.

   2. You need to have `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`__ installed (as
      part of your Python environment installation).

   3. You need a `GitHub <https://github.com>`__ account
      (if you want to deploy the documentation via GitHub).
