## There is not the one right way: it is always a balance


**Jupyter notebooks can be good documentation for scripts**

- For simple scripts and post-processing, Jupyter notebooks can form a nice
  self-documenting pipeline.


**README.md or README.rst?**

- Functionality-wise both Markdown and RST are very similar.
- With RST you can generate a table of contents (TOC) automatically by adding `.. contents:: Table of Contents`.
- On GitLab you can generate a TOC in Markdown with `[[_TOC_]]`.
- Nowadays also GitHub generates a
  [TOC for README.md](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-readmes#auto-generated-table-of-contents-for-readme-files).
- If you need math equations, RST/Sphinx might be a good fit.
- Resizing images in README.rst on GitHub is currently not easy.


**READMEs or Sphinx?**

- For smaller projects READMEs can be absolutely enough.
- If the code is closed-source, you probably prefer Sphinx (or similar).


**How to make sure that code changes come together with documentation changes?**

- Make documentation part of your code review.


**Sphinx/RTD or GitHub pages or both?**

- GitHub pages typically serves one version (one branch). It is often used as the project/group/personal page.
- RTD can serve several versions (several branches/tags) at the same time.
- Some projects use both.
