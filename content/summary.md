## There is not the one right way: it is always a balance


**Jupyter notebooks can be good documentation for scripts**

- For simple scripts and post-processing, Jupyter notebooks can form a nice
  self-documenting pipeline.


**READMEs or Sphinx?**

- For smaller projects READMEs can be absolutely enough.
- If the code is closed-source, you probably prefer Sphinx (or similar).
- If you need math equations, Sphinx might be a good fit.


**How to make sure that code changes come together with documentation changes?**

- Make documentation part of your code review.


**ReadTheDocs or GitHub pages or both?**

- GitHub pages typically serves one version (one branch).
- Read the Docs can serve several versions (several branches/tags) at the same time.
- Some projects use both.
