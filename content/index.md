# How to document your research software

In this lesson we will discuss different solutions for implementing and
deploying code documentation.

We will start with a discussion about **what makes a good README**. For many
projects, a README is more than enough.

We will then learn how to build documentation with the
**documentation generator** [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) (and compare it
with others) and how to
deploy it to [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org), a service which hosts
open documentation for free.

This demonstration will be **independent of programming languages**.

We will also learn how
to deploy a **project website or personal homepage** to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
The approach that we will learn will be transferable to
[GitLab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/) and
[Bitbucket Pages](https://pages.bitbucket.io).

```{prereq}
1. Basic understanding of Git.

2. For the Sphinx part, You need to have
   [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) and [sphinx_rtd_theme](https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/) installed
   (they are part of the [coderefinery environment](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/conda-environment/)).

3. For the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) part you need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
