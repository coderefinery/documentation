# Code documentation lesson

In this lesson we will learn the basics for writing good software documentation.

We will discuss why documentation is important and what makes good documentation.

We will learn how to write good in-code documentation and a good ReadMe file.

We will demo how you can setup a more extensive documentation using the
**documentation generator** [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) and how to
deploy it to [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org), a service which hosts
open documentation for free.

We will also learn how
to deploy a **project website or personal homepage** to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
The approach that we will learn will be transferable to
[GitLab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/) and
[Bitbucket Pages](https://pages.bitbucket.io).

Although we often use Python as an example language, everything that you will learn is independent of programming
languages.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> 1. Basic understanding of Git.
> 2. You need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
